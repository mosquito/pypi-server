This program starts the server with all plugins configured.

At startup, and even to show this help, the program scans all available plugins, and logs their arguments.

Each plugin contains an activation flag, while reacting to it depending on the implementation.

Plugins can be included together, then their behavior will be described by the following rules. Firstly, requests to plugins will be made at the same time.

In the event that a request requires a response from only one plugin, in this case the order of the call and the expected behavior are not guaranteed.

For example, if several plugins that provide storage of binary blobs are enabled, then the request to save the blob will be redirected to all plugins at the same time, while the request to receive the blob will be sent to only one of the plugins.
